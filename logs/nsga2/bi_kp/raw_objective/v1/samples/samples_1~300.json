The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have 2 existing algorithms with their codes as follows:\nNo. 1 algorithm and the corresponding code are:\n{The algorithm selects a solution from the archive based on a combined objective score, then applies a novel hybrid local search that combines item swaps, probabilistic flips, and a value-weighted randomization step to explore the solution space while ensuring feasibility.}\ndef select_neighbor(archive: List[Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[float, float]]], weight_lst: np.ndarray, value1_lst: np.ndarray, value2_lst: np.ndarray, capacity: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    if len(archive) > 1:\n        # Calculate potential improvement score (weighted sum of both objectives)\n        scores = [obj[0] * 0.7 + obj[1] * 0.3 for (sol, obj) in archive]\n        selected_idx = np.argmax(scores)\n        base_solution = archive[selected_idx][0].copy()\n    else:\n        base_solution = archive[0][0].copy()\n\n    new_solution = base_solution.copy()\n    n_items = len(weight_lst)\n    current_weight = np.sum(weight_lst[new_solution == 1])\n\n    # Step 1: Perform item swaps with value-weighted probability\n    for _ in range(min(5, n_items // 3)):\n        included = np.where(new_solution == 1)[0]\n        excluded = np.where(new_solution == 0)[0]\n\n        if len(included) > 0 and len(excluded) > 0:\n            # Select items with probability proportional to their combined value\n            total_value = np.sum(value1_lst[included]) + np.sum(value2_lst[included])\n            if total_value > 0:\n                probs = (value1_lst[included] + value2_lst[included]) / total_value\n                i = np.random.choice(included, p=probs)\n            else:\n                i = random.choice(included)\n\n            j = random.choice(excluded)\n\n            # Check feasibility of swap\n            if current_weight -

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have 2 existing algorithms with their codes as follows:\nNo. 1 algorithm and the corresponding code are:\n{}\ndef select_neighbor(archive: List[Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[float, float]]], weight_lst: np.ndarray, value1_lst: np.ndarray, value2_lst: np.ndarray, capacity: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    if not archive:\n        raise ValueError(\"Archive is empty.\")\n\n    # Select the solution with the highest ratio of value2 to value1 (0.6*value2/value1 + 0.4*value2)\n    weighted_values = [0.6 * (v2 / (v1 + 1e-10)) + 0.4 * v2 for _, (v1, v2) in archive]\n    max_weighted = max(weighted_values)\n    candidates = [sol for (sol, (v1, v2)) in archive if 0.6 * (v2 / (v1 + 1e-10)) + 0.4 * v2 == max_weighted]\n\n    if not candidates:\n        base_solution = archive[0][0].copy()\n    else:\n        base_solution = random.choice(candidates).copy()\n\n    new_solution = base_solution.copy()\n\n    # Apply a hybrid local search strategy:\n    # 1.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have 2 existing algorithms with their codes as follows:\nNo. 1 algorithm and the corresponding code are:\n{}\ndef select_neighbor(archive: List[Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[float, float]]], weight_lst: np.ndarray, value1_lst: np.ndarray, value2_lst: np.ndarray, capacity: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    if not archive:\n        raise ValueError(\"Archive is empty.\")\n\n    # Select the solution with the highest ratio of value2 to value1 (0.6*value2/value1 + 0.4*value2)\n    weighted_values = [0.6 * (v2 / (v1 + 1e-10)) + 0.4 * v2 for _, (v1, v2) in archive]\n    max_weighted = max(weighted_values)\n    candidates = [sol for (sol, (v1, v2)) in archive if 0.6 * (v2 / (v1 + 1e-10)) + 0.4 * v2 == max_weighted]\n\n    if not candidates:\n        base_solution = archive[0][0].copy()\n    else:\n        base_solution = random.choice(candidates).copy()\n\n    new_solution = base_solution.copy()\n\n    # Apply a hybrid local search strategy:\n    # 1.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.

The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.
