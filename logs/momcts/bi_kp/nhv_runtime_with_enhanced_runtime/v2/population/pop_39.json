        "algorithm": "The algorithm uses \u03b5-dominance ranking to select high-quality, diverse solutions from the archive, then applies a hybrid local search combining weighted marginal gain prioritization (with adaptive weights based on current knapsack utilization) and targeted perturbations (flipping 1-3 random items with probability dependent on capacity usage), ensuring feasibility at every step. The weighted marginal gain balances both objectives dynamically, while adaptive perturbations introduce controlled exploration.",
