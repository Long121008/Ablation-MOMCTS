        "algorithm": "The algorithm selects a promising solution from the archive using \u03b5-dominance ranking, then applies a weighted marginal gain-based local search to flip items, prioritizing objective 1 when the knapsack is nearly full and balancing both objectives otherwise, with adaptive perturbations to explore further improvements while maintaining feasibility. It ensures feasibility through multiple checks and corrective measures, including removing low-marginal-gain items when capacity is exceeded. The overall structure balances exploration (via \u03b5-dominance and perturbations) with exploitation (via marginal gain prioritization), with special attention to objective prioritization based on current knapsack state.",
