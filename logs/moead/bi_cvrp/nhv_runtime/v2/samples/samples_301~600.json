        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (Bi-CVRP), where a single depot and multiple customers are located in 2D space. Each customer has a positive demand, and all vehicles in the fleet have identical capacity limits. The objective is to construct a set of routes, each starting and ending at the depot, such that all customers are served, vehicle capacities are not exceeded on any route, and two conflicting objectives are minimized: (1) the total travel distance across all routes, and (2) the makespan, defined as the length of the longest individual route. Each solution in the archive is represented as a list of NumPy arrays, where each array denotes a single route (starting and ending with depot index 0), and is paired with a tuple of two objective values (total_distance, makespan). Your task is to implement a function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one promising solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a feasible neighbor solution from it. Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself. Avoid standard methods like pure 2-opt; instead, invent or combine transformations, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. Ensure that the returned neighbor solution remains feasible under the vehicle capacity constraint.
