It then intelligently selects a solution from the archive with a high probability proportional to its improvement potential, ensuring diversity in selection through a temperature-based stochastic process. The selected solution undergoes a novel hybrid local search operator that combines 2-opt edge swaps with a multi-objective-aware segment reversal, where the reversal is biased towards segments that show the most promising reduction in the worst objective value among the three. The operator ensures feasibility by strictly maintaining the permutation property of the tour, and the neighbor solution is validated to confirm it remains a valid TSP tour before being returned.}",
