Then, it applies a creative local search operator that dynamically adjusts the neighborhood size based on the solution's current position in the objective space, flipping bits in a non-uniform manner to balance exploration and exploitation. The operator ensures feasibility by only considering flips that maintain the weight constraint, and it incorporates a probabilistic acceptance criterion to escape local optima.
