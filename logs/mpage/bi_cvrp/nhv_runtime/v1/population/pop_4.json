          "algorithm": "{The novel local search strategy, named \"Adaptive Route Fusion and Splitting with Demand-Aware Relocation,\" combines three key operations: (1) probabilistically merging adjacent routes based on their demand proximity to avoid capacity violations, (2) intelligently splitting long routes into shorter segments while ensuring demand feasibility, and (3) demand-aware relocation of customers between routes by prioritizing nodes with high demand to balance makespan and total distance. The algorithm first selects a solution from the archive using a tournament selection biased toward lower makespan but considering total distance as a tiebreaker. It then applies the three operations in sequence, with each step checking feasibility and only proceeding if improvements are detected. The demand-aware relocation step uses a heuristic to select customers for relocation based on their demand and distance to nearby routes, ensuring the neighbor solution remains feasible while potentially reducing both objectives.}",
