          "algorithm": "{The novel local search strategy, named \"Adaptive Route Fusion and Splitting with Demand-Aware Relocation,\" combines three key operations: (1) probabilistically merging adjacent routes based on their demand proximity to avoid capacity violations, (2) intelligently splitting long routes into shorter segments while ensuring demand feasibility, and (3) demand-aware relocation of customers between routes by prioritizing nodes with high demand to balance makespan and total distance. The algorithm first selects a solution from the archive using a tournament selection biased toward lower makespan but considering total distance as a tiebreaker. It then applies the three operations in sequence, with each step checking feasibility and only proceeding if improvements are detected. The demand-aware relocation step uses a heuristic to select customers for relocation based on their demand and distance to nearby routes, ensuring the neighbor solution remains feasible while potentially reducing both objectives.}",

First, the algorithm selects a solution from the archive based on a weighted random selection favoring solutions with lower total distance or shorter makespan, or those with a balanced trade-off between the two objectives. Then, it identifies critical routes (either the longest or those with high demand) and performs a route-splitting operation by removing a subset of customers from the route, creating a new route with those customers. Next, it reallocates the remaining customers to other routes using a greedy insertion strategy that minimizes the increase in total distance while respecting capacity constraints. Finally, the algorithm attempts to merge adjacent routes if their combined load does not exceed capacity and if merging reduces the total distance or makespan. The neighbor solution is validated for feasibility before being returned.}",

First, it selects a promising solution from the archive by prioritizing those with high average route efficiency (distance per unit demand) and low makespan, then randomly perturbs the solution by fragmenting long routes into smaller segments and redistributing these segments into other routes or new routes while ensuring capacity constraints are met. The algorithm adaptively adjusts insertion points based on geographic proximity and demand compatibility, using a simulated annealing-like acceptance criterion to escape local optima while favoring improvements in both objectives. The neighbor solution is generated by iteratively applying these transformations until no further feasible improvements are found, with each step ensuring vehicle capacity constraints are preserved through demand validation.}",
